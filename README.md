# McColin.com Octopress Theme

A lightweight, sidebar-to-header swapping responsive theme for Octopress and
intended for use on [my personal website][http://mccolin.com/].

Savvy folks are free to clone and customize the theme
[from github][http://github.com/mccolin/mccolincom-octo]
freely, provided a reference to the theme's repository or mccolin.com remains
a component.
